Hello from the utils module!
Welcome to 'Commitment Issues: Variables and Data Types'!
Today, we'll explore Rust's quirky variable and data type relationships.
Commitment Issues: Why can't variables and types just get along?
- A string says, 'I'm here for the long haul, but only with text.'
- An int replies, 'Numbers are my thing, and I prefer no decimal drama.'
- A float counters, 'Decimals? Drama? No, it's elegance.'
- A bool smirks, 'True or false, I'm all about commitment.'

Meet our star:
- Name: Ferris ðŸ¦€ (string)
- Age: 10 (int)
- Height: 1.75 (float64)
- Is Ferris ðŸ¦€ cute? true (bool)

But wait, what happens if we try mixing them?
- Ferris ðŸ¦€ says, 'Hey, can I combine age and height?'
Result: 11.75 (age + height)

Generating SHA256 IDs for some favorite variables:
- Ferris ðŸ¦€: 3c761a69bf58cc45ead7224018a73d54876f4bd5ce45f59a9ae5cb237fe31153
- 10: 4a44dc15364204a80fe80e9039455cc1608281820fe2b24f1e5233ade6af1dd5
- 1.75: f4881c772c8950930750e103abbe15b6720b84168921e66850d5800500ea0865
- true: b5bea41b6c623f7c09f1bf24dcae58ebab3c0cdd90ad966bc43a45b44867e12b

A constant reminder: Keep coding and stay quirky!

And remember: Variables may have commitment issues, but constants are forever.
