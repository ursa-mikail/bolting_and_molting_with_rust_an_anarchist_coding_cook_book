✅ Structured Modules – Follows Rust's idiomatic modularization.
✅ Error Handling with `Result<>` – Uses `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors.
✅ Graceful Panic Recovery – Uses `catch_unwind()` to handle critical failures in logs.
✅ Randomized Simulations – Mirrors the Go version’s unpredictability with rand.
✅ Easily Extendable – The modular structure makes it easy to add more functionalities.
